# corerun

A Rust command line application for core dump analysis and process memory recreation using advanced memory mapping techniques.

## Overview

corerun is a sophisticated tool for reconstructing process memory from core dump files. It parses both MachO and ELF core dump formats, recreates the original process memory layout using `mach_vm_remap` for efficient copy-on-write mapping, and restores thread states to enable debugging of crashed processes.

## Features (generated by Claude AI)

- **Multi-format Support**: Handles both MachO and ELF core dump formats
- **Advanced Memory Mapping**: Uses `mach_vm_remap` with copy-on-write for efficient memory recreation
- **Thread State Restoration**: Recreates threads with original CPU register states and exception information
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Intelligently handles memory address conflicts with retry logic
- **Bootstrap IPC**: Clean inter-process communication using Mach bootstrap services
- **Protection Handling**: Preserves original memory protection flags (read/write/execute)

## Requirements

- Currently supported on macOS only (tested on macOS 14+)
- Rust 1.70+
- The target process needs the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement for core dump generation (automatically granted for debug builds)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/corerun.git
cd corerun
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./target/release/corerun /path/to/core.dump
```

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about the parsing and mapping process:

```bash
./target/release/corerun -v /path/to/core.dump
```

## Example Output

```

## Architecture

corerun uses a sophisticated multi-process architecture:

1. **Parent Process**: Parses the core dump, manages memory mapping, and coordinates the recreation
2. **Target Process**: Empty process that receives memory segments and thread states
3. **Bootstrap IPC**: Secure communication channel for task port exchange
4. **Memory Mapping**: Efficient COW mapping using `mach_vm_remap` from parent to child

### Key Components

- **Core File Parser**: Handles both MachO and ELF formats with proper segment and thread state parsing
- **Process Controller**: Manages the target process lifecycle and IPC communication  
- **Memory Manager**: Advanced memory mapping with conflict resolution and protection handling
- **Task Port Exchange**: Secure bootstrap-based IPC for task port acquisition

## Protection Flags

Protection flags are displayed in verbose mode:
- `R--`: Read-only (0x1)
- `-W-`: Write-only (0x2) 
- `--X`: Execute-only (0x4)
- `RW-`: Read+Write (0x3)
- `R-X`: Read+Execute (0x5)
- `RWX`: Read+Write+Execute (0x7)
- `---`: No access (0x0)

## Debugging

After corerun recreates the process memory, you can attach a debugger:

```bash
lldb -p <target_process_pid>
```

The process will be suspended with all original thread states and memory layout restored.

## Development

```bash
cargo build --bin empty_process  # Build the target process binary
cargo build                      # Build the main corerun binary
```
